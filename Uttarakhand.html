Located at the foothills of the Himalayan mountain ranges, it is largely a hilly State, having international boundaries with China (Tibet) in the north and Nepal in the east.March to April and September to October are considered as the best time to visit Uttarakhand. The state has wonderful weather all through the year. Trekking, Paragliding and The Char Dham Yatra are the most popular activities during Summer, which is also the Peak Season in Uttarakhand.</p>
