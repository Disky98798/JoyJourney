<h2 align="centre">About the Heart Of India</h2>
<p style="font-family:Times new roman"> Embedded in the heart of India is Uttar Pradesh, a land where cultures have evolved and religions have emerged. The greatness of Uttar Pradesh lies not only in this confluence but also in the emegence of cultural and religious traditions along some of the greatest rivers in the Indian subcontinent, the Ganga and the Yamuna. Through history, great cities have emerged and been established along great rivers. Within India, the Ganga and the Yamuna have nurtured a culture because of which religious faith, rituals, culture, and intellectual enlightenment have evolved in places along the two rivers.Uttar Pradesh is a colorful land filled with ancient culture, spirituality, and good food. The state is a mixture of the various cultures that existed in it at some point of time, prominent ones whose remnants can still be found today include the Awadh and the Mughal culture. You can visit Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Varanasi if you are looking for a spiritual experience and relax along the Ghats of river Ganges or explore the city of Agra, once a Mughal capital. </p>
