<p style="font-family:times new roman">Kerala is a beautiful state in India that is known for its beautiful green landscapes, peaceful backwaters, and deep culture. Situated on the southwestern coast of India, Kerala is also known as “God’s Own Country” because of its wonderful natural beauty.One of the most renowned attractions in Kerala is its backwaters. These are a network of interconnected canals, rivers, lakes, and lagoons that run parallel to the Arabian Sea coast. Tourists can enjoy a peaceful boat ride through the backwaters while enjoying the beautiful view and spotting rare birds and marine life. The backwaters are also home to traditional houseboats called “kettuvallams,” where visitors can spend a night or two experiencing the unique way of life in Kerala.In food, Kerala shows a beautiful collection of flavours and dishes. The cooking is primarily based on rice, coconut, and seafood, and is known for its use of fragrant spices like black pepper, cardamom, and cloves. Some must-try dishes include appam with stew, fish curry, and banana fritters.</p>
