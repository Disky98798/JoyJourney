<p style="font-family:times new roman">Tamil Nadu is a state with diverse tourist attractions and a thriving tourism industry. Its mountains and vegetation, beaches, wildlife, monuments and temples, and rustic rural life beckon visitors. Popular hill stations include Ooty, Kodaikanal, Yercaud, Elagiri, Javvadhu Hills, Kolli Hills, Sirumalai Hills, Valparai, Topslip, Parvathamalai Hills and Pachamalai Hills. Famous waterfalls include the cascades in Courtallam, Hogenakkal, Thiruparappu, Monkey Falls, Thirumurthi Hills, Agaya Gangai and Papanasam Falls.
Along the north-central coast of Tamil Nadu are the enclaves of Puducherry and Karaikal, both of which are part of the Puducherry union territory. Chennai (formerly known as Madras) is the capital city, located on the northeastern coast of the state. Tamil Nadu represents the Tamil-speaking area of what was formerly the Madras Presidency of British India.</p>
